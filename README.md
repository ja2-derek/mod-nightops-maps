First introduced to Stracciatella in commit ([6874b4e3](https://github.com/ja2-stracciatella/ja2-stracciatella/tree/6874b4e356bd48e36bb9dfc899620a9607b95ea9/mods/nightops-maps)) but never merged.

This map pack contains more than 60 town and strategically important sectors from Night Ops mod, adapted to the original balance of Jagged Alliance 2.
